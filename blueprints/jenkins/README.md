This Blueprint installs a CentOS server with the latest version of Jenkins on it. 

After deployment, Jenkins will be accessible at http://IP_OF_NEW_SERVER:8080/. 

Let us know if you find this useful and would like to see improvements to it. We could add the URL to the deployed service, add options for what port Jenkins listens on, what plugins to install, optional deployment of Jenkins agent nodes, etc.
